# install-tools
Install tools to help get up and running as fast as possible.

## Windows

### Tips
1. It is assumed that Chocolatey is installed.
2. Install scripts should be run in a PowerShell as an administrator.
3. An environment variable <tt>DEV_BIN</tt> is expected to exist. This is where
  software will be installed.
4. In the PowerShell, run this to enable scripts to run, just for the current
  session:
  <tt>Set-ExecutionPolicy  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force</tt>
